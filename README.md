# Hi, here i've implemented Web scraping script to get Eth value from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

## A little more info:

+ Script supports continuous working without **internet connection**(Retry every one minute);
+ Data is writting to .csv file every **5 minutes** as refresh time on site is it;
+ Here in .csv file i've collected **40** record for a little more that **3 hours**;
+ Created graph from obtained dataset is compared to CoinMarketCap graph with 13 to 16 interval;
